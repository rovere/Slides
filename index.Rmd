    * Full details available [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/320094/contribution/0/material/slides/0.pdf)
	* The new simulation of Pixel Dynamic Inefficiency entered
          [**pre6**](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/3140) and
          was _fixed_ in
          [**pre8**](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/3689)

## Approvals

* We recently <font class="red">approved many plots</font> that could be useful in preparing slides/posters for future conferences.
* The TWiki page collecting all of them is available [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/TrackingPOGPlots2014)
* Among many, the new approved plots include:
    1. Effect of iteration 9&10 on muon reconstruction efficieny
    1. Reconstruction efficiency vs pt for all iterations
    1. Many timing plots, especially useful to better understand the effect of PU on tracking-time.
    1. Number of masked/unmasked clusters for different iterations
* Each plot has a corresponding explanation on the TWiki page.
