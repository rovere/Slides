## Tracking Training Day II - The Revenge

* The second edition of the Tracking Training Day has happened on
  Monday 20th of October.

* The attendance was good and the (private) feedback that we received
  so far was good.

* The quality of the theoretical session was indeed outstanding.

    * Special thanks to <font class="bold red">Boris Mangano</font>
      and <font class="bold red">Giacomo Sguazzoni</font> for their
      availability.

* We are thinking to review a bit the hand-on session to make it a
  little more interactive and useful:

    * suggestions on this specific topic are very welcome.
