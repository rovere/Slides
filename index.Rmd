## Early-data activities

* Last week we had a chat with Physics Coordination to plan
  Tracking-related activities on the first data we will collect.

## Tentative plan

* Be ready with basic performance plots of tracking and vertexing for
  the summer conferences in July, based on low-lumi and 50ns
  runs.

* Given the limited time, we agreed to provide only DP Notes, saving
  more refined studies/PAS for later on.

* In particular we agreed to focus our attention on:

   * close collaboration with FSQ group to be ready with the very
     first paper $dN/d\eta$ .

   * Beampipe position measurements

   * V0's

   * Vertex efficiency

   * Tracking efficiency from D* decays

   * Beamspot Plots

* We would like to have, for each specific topic, a pool of people
  that would commit to follow up the analysis, both with early data
  and, possibly, also later on, with 25 ns data.

* There are some "natural" candidates that come to out mind: yet we
  would like to x-check with you all if you are available.

* <font class="bold green">This is not a request coming from Tracking POG, but it is coming
  from CMS/Physics Coordination</font>
