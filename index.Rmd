## 0 Tesla saga

* As everyone knows by now, we are having few problems with the CMS
  Magnet

* Many runs in the past days have been taken w/ beam (and collisions)
  with 0T, w/o pixels.

* The vanilla RunII candidate tracking is not performing at the top
  (many caveat here: 0T, no pixels, wrong timing, CCC, cluster shape
  filters, conditions, Gains, ...)

* Few patches have been (privately) produced and privately applied in
  the release to reach better performances (mainly by our Tracker DPG
  friends).

* We are foreseen to take data this week, with 50ns BX, pixel on and
  0T.

* In order to maximize the "tracking outcome", we backported the
  RunI-like tracking configuration in 74X (it was already in in 75X)
  (see [PR-9269](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/9296))

* A new 74 release will be soon out with this configuration suggested
  by us as the default tracking configuration for runs at 0T: all
  other runs taken in "nominal" conditions will use the vanilla RunII
  tracking, that has been developed and optimized in the past 2 years
  for this purpose.

* Fresh of the press: [plots](http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/Physics/tracking/validation/MC/CMSSW_7_4_4/MCRUN2_740TV1_0Tv2_noPU_highPurity/RelValTTbar/effandfake1.pdf)

## RunI-like, RunII-patched on recent data

* we privately tested the performance of the RunII-patched and
  RunI-like tracking both on recently taken data and on an old run
  taken during RunI/Run2012C, with 0T and with pixels: results are
  encouraging.
