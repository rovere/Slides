## Introduction

### Motivations

* Test of tracking and vertexing with different PU scenarios
    * test different releases (53X ~ Run1, 72X ~ Run2)

### Hardware

* Evaluate the overall performance gain(physics/timing) after several months
  of intense development
    * Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.5GHz

### Samples

* Privately produced samples with STARTUP conditions:
   * BX: 50 and 25 ns
   * PU: 25, 40, 70, 140
   * without (default) and with pixel dynamic
* Limits on `Nclusters` and `Nseeds` have been removed
   * avoid biasing timing and efficiency
   * they are not tuned for PU > 70

## Introduction

### Selections
   * consider only HighPurity tracks
   * use track associator by hits (threshold > 75%)
   * fake rate: all tracks
   * efficiency:
      * vs : pT>0.9 GeV, VZ<30 cm, VR<3.5 cm
      * vs R: pT>0.5 GeV, VZ<150 cm, ||<2.5 cm
   * vertices, association by position ( $\Delta$ z < 3 $\sigma_z$, $\Delta$ z < 1 mm): 
      * ndof > 4, |z| < 24 cm, R < 2 cm

### In this talk we will present results related to:

* New development for Run 2
   * main focus on development tailor to have a sensitive time reduction with high PU
* Tracking Performances
* Timing Performances
* Vertexing Performances

## New development for Run 2

## Strip Triplet Seeding

Previous studies showed that timing of iterations seeded from pairs of
strip hits diverges at high pile-up. A new seeding algorithm, based on hit
triplets, whose main feature is a chi2 cut from straight line fit of 3
points in the RZ plane has been developer to cure pixelLess=iter5 and
tobTec=iter6.  

*** =caption_left

Number of seeds vs eta for the strip-seeded iterations, comparing the
pair-based algorithm with the new triplet-based one. Plots are
stacked. The new algorithm reduces the number of seeds by a factor 2x.

*** =caption_right

Number of recosntructed high purity tracks vs pT for the strip-seeded
iterations, comparing the pair-based algorithm with the new
triplet-based one. Plots are stacked. The new algorithm reconstructed
approximately the same number of tracks.
